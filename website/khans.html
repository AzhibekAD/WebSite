			<strong>Tauke khan</strong> <b>(1635-1715)</b> - Khan of the younger zhuz since 1652, and since 1672-ruler of the Kazakh Khanate, son of Khan Salkam Zhangir. Her mother, Banu Hanim, is the daughter of the Ruler of the khoshouyt tribe of Kalmyk, Kunden-Taishi. When he inherited the reins of power of the Kazakh Khanate (1680), Tauke was a skilled man who came of age and stopped thinking, intervened in the affairs of the state and gained a lot of experience. So he took the throne and went on with his father's business, and although he pursued his policy, he did not leave the old path when it came to its implementation, but went on his own new path. Tauke is distinguished from other Kazakh Khans by the fact that he is a visionary leader, a wise reformer. At the same time, he adapts to his great ancestor Kasym Khan.<br>
